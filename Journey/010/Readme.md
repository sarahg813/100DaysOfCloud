# IAM Groups and How to Create them 

## Introduction

- An IAM Group is a collection of IAM Users

## Cloud Research

- Groups let you specify permissions for multiple Users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those Users.
- You can't have a login to IAM Groups and they don't have any credentials.
- An IAM User can be a member of multiple Groups. 
- Groups can have policies attached to them. 
- Groups can't be referenced as a principal in a policy. 
- There's no limit for the number of Users in an IAM Group.
- You can't have any nesting in Groups such as Groups within Groups. 
- There's a limit of 300 Groups per account but you can increase that by creating a support ticket with AWS.
