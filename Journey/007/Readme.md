# Learned about VPC

## Introduction

- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 

## Cloud Research
- VPCs are regionally resilient. 
- VPCs operate from multiple AZs in a specific AWS region
- You can have one Default VPC in one region but you can have many Custom VPCs in a region.
- VPCs can't communicate outside of their specific private network. 
- Every VPC is allocated a range of IP addresses called the VPC CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing - is a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing in which collection of Internet Protocol (IP) standards used to create unique identifiers for networks and individual devices.)
