# Create an Inline Policy for an IAM User

## Cloud Research

- An inline policy is a policy that's embedded in an IAM identity (a user, group, or role). That is, the policy is an inherent part of the identity. 
- This is for exceptions to the normal access rights that you want to grant such as special circumstances, when you need to ensure a specific set of rights for an individual. 
- You can give an individual identity more access rights or blocking certain permissions.
