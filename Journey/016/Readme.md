## Cloud Research

- Bucket Policies are a type of AWS resource policy 
- S3 is private by default & permissions have to be explicitly granted 
- A resource policy is like an identity policy but theyâ€™re attached to resources instead of identities such as an S3 bucket
- They can allow access from the same account or different accounts because the policy is attached to the resource, and it can reference any other identities inside that policy
- They also can allow or deny anonymous principals
- There can only be one bucket policy on a bucket but can have multiple statements.
