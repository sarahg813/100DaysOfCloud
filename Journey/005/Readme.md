Differences Between Types of Clouds

## Cloud Research

Today I learned about the different types of cloud:
- The Public Cloud - is a cloud environment that is available to the public. AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offers public cloud platforms. 
- The Multi Cloud - allows you to use multiple cloud environments such as hosting a part of your system on AWS and another on Azure. 
- The Private Cloud - You can have a solution dedicated to your business and have it run on-premises. AWS Outposts, Azure Stack, and Google: Anthos offers private cloud platforms. 
- The Hybrid Cloud - is when you use the public cloud and private cloud together in a single environment. Not to get it mixed up with having a Hybrid Environment which is when users utilize a public cloud with on-premises equipment.
